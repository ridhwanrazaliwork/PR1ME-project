            "random-contract.jpg": "CONTRACTING GUIDELINES Making contracts with your child provides an opportunity for your child to make appropriate choices about their behavior: The idea is to help a child learn to be responsible for his/her own behavior: The idea is not to control the child, but to provide the child with the means to control him or herself: Every contract should outline what behavior is expected, the child s responsibility to meet that expectation, and a consequence (logical, i.e. Relates to the violation and is not punitive) for not meeting their responsibility: contract accomplishes several (1) the parent and the child have a clear understanding of what the behaviors and limits should be. (2) If the child breaks the contract; the parent does not have to angry or raise their voice. A simple, `I see that you have chosen (the consequence) instead of (name rule the violation)' will do. Children usually feel bad enough for disappointing themselves and their parents and lectures and anger only hurts them more_ Remember that you are trying to teach your child how to make responsible choices, not hurt or shame them_ (3) Contracts help to encourage a child, and show that you believe that will make responsible choices. Contracts should be negotiated in a democratic way: The child should have an equal role in the development Ideally, parents will have several non-negotiable items such as drug and alcohol abuse, smoking; etc. The parents should work through the enclosed worksheet together and be in complete agreement on the contract proposal. If both parents cannot agree and be willing to support the contract items, then there is little chance of success_ Be prepared to compromise in some areas; so your child can  feel like helshe has gained something: It is important to the success of a contract if the child believes that helshe has gained something in the process It is not very likely that your child's first offer will be completely acceptable, but look through it (it should be in writing) and try to find points of agreement: On the points of disagreement; let your child know of your position and Then ask your child why it is important to them that it be the way are asking (you may have to help your child discern why it is important to him/her): This can be a wonderful opportunity to learn about your child. It can also be a great time to discuss values. Listen with understanding and be cautious about discounting the child's reasoning: If you can't agree to the child's offer; present a compromise position. When all items have been negotiated, write it down on paper, make a copy and both the parents and the child sign and date it. Let the child a copy, and the parents a copy: When disagreements arise regarding behaviors or consequences, you can refer to the signed document to settle it (no arguing). A contract should be negotiated with each child   Modify the contract to be age specific and be cautious about gender stereotyping: Chores  offer the child an opportunity to contribute to the operation of the household Allowances should not be connected to performance or chores, but rather a means to teach your child money management: Consider giving older (11-10+) children their allowance on a monthly basis. This allows them to larger ticket items, and teaches them to manage their money over a longer period. It is critically important that both   parents be consistent   with the administration of the contract. INCONSISTENCY CONFUSES CHILDREN. In blended families, both parents should be in agreement on the contract content, but the biological parent should be the one to present it to their child: Also address the issue of who is in charge when the biological parent is not available Provided by Bert Welch for Siouxland CARES. things: get they why: they keep keep buy"

(2) If the child breaks the contract; the parent does not have to angry or raise their voice. A simple, `I see that you have chosen (the consequence) instead of (name rule the violation)' will do. Children usually feel bad enough for disappointing themselves and their parents and lectures and anger only hurts them more_ Remember that you are trying to teach your child how to make responsible choices, not hurt or shame them_ (3) Contracts help to encourage a child, and show that you believe that will make responsible choices.

It can also be a great time to discuss values. Listen with understanding and be cautious about discounting the child's reasoning: If you can't agree to the child's offer; present a compromise position. When all items have been negotiated, write it down on paper, make a copy and both the parents and the child sign and date it.
